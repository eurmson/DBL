Starting a README so that we can keep track of all commits and changes.

I added a Cargo.toml file with the project name: Final_project_test that will be appended later. I also added the main.rs file, which handles the input handler and output handling modules. In this file, I got the minimal prototype to work for initializing
an empty repository. Both the input and output handlers are done within the main file, which is also in charge of building the project. I also added the file_management.rs file that I made to test the functionality of the input and output handling modules.
The file_management module will be updated later, but I added it just to show my work for testing purposes. - George
